# SW Missouri No-Till Perennial + Nurse-Crop Plan for Goats

---

## Seed Mix (per acre, fall drill)

| Species | Rate (lb/acre) | Lifecycle | Benefit | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Orchardgrass | 8 | Perennial | Persistent base, tall cool-season grass | Drill ¼–½"; avoid grazing first year |
| Chicory | 3 | Perennial | Deep taproot, nutrient-dense, mineral-rich | Well-drained soil; don't graze <4–5" |
| Birdsfoot trefoil | 3 | Perennial | Condensed tannins, bloat-safe, parasite control | Slow to establish; allow occasional seed-set |
| Red clover | 4 | Perennial (short-lived) | High protein, fills gaps | Overseed as needed |
| White clover | 2 | Perennial | Nitrogen fixer, fills low spots | Keep moderate grazing height |
| Sericea lespedeza (AU Grazer) | 2–3 | Perennial | Tannin forage for parasite suppression | Dense stand needed for effectiveness |
| Oats | 15 | Annual | Fast fall forage, protects seedlings | Grazable in fall; dies over winter |
| Cereal rye | 15 | Annual | Winter hardy, tall biomass | Grazable lightly; thins by spring |
| Triticale | 10 | Annual | Rapid establishment, weed suppression | Dies or thins by late spring |

**Notes:**

- Nurse crops (annuals) establish quickly, provide early forage, and shade perennials.  
- Perennials build long-term forage and help with parasite suppression.

## Month-by-Month Establishment & Grazing

| Month | Activities | Grazing Guidance |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| September | Soil test, lime/fertilizer, firm seedbed, drill seed mix | Keep animals off for 2–3 weeks until emergence |
| October | Check seedlings; first leaves visible | Still avoid grazing perennials; nurse crops can be lightly grazed if pressure low |
| November | Nurse crops established | Light grazing on nurse crops; protect perennials; stock density low |
| December–February | Dormant growth | Minimal grazing; hay supplement as needed |
| March | Perennials resume growth | Begin light rotational grazing; residual: orchardgrass 3–4", chicory/trefoil 4–5" |
| April | Active growth | Moderate rotation; monitor regrowth; avoid overgrazing crowns |
| May | Well-rooted perennials | Full rotational grazing begins; occasional trefoil seed-set for stand maintenance |
| June–August | Summer growth | Maintain rotation, residuals, monitor tannin forage access for parasite control |

## Stocking & Rotation Plan

- **Paddocks:** 8 (~0.875 acres each)  
- **Rotation:** 1 paddock per week  
- **DM Demand:** 25 goats × 150 lbs × 4% BW/day → 1,050 lbs DM/week  
- **Available DM per paddock:** ~2,188 lbs → ~50% utilization → light grazing  

**Residual height targets:**

- Orchardgrass/fescue: ≥3–4"  
- Chicory/trefoil: ≥4–5"  
- Clovers: ≥3–4"  

**Supplement:** 1 square bale/week during establishment reduces grazing pressure slightly  

**Tips:**

- Monitor paddocks for bare spots, pulled tillers, or low crowns.  
- Adjust rotation frequency or reduce herd density if seedlings stressed.  
- Use nurse crops as natural forage buffer; no fencing needed.

## Success Notes / Research-Backed Tips

- Sericea lespedeza (AU Grazer) reduces fecal egg counts in goats when consumed adequately.  
- Chicory adds mineral-dense forage and height for browsing.  
- Birdsfoot trefoil provides tannins, bloat-safe protein, and persists under rotational grazing.  
- Full-field no-till + nurse crops shown in Missouri and surrounding states to establish perennials without taking paddocks completely out of rotation.
