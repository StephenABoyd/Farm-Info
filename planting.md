**Notes:**
- Drill perennials that require depth; broadcast small seeds and nurse crops.
- Residual heights guide rotational grazing; max heights indicate safe limits before digestibility declines.
- Tall tannin forages like sericea and trefoil can remain slightly taller for parasite control.

## Month-by-Month Establishment & Grazing

| Month     | Activities                                                   | Grazing Guidance                                                                                   |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| September | Soil test, lime/fertilizer, firm seedbed, drill/broadcast seed mix | Keep animals off for 2–3 weeks until emergence                                                     |
| October   | Check seedlings; first leaves visible                        | Light grazing on nurse crops only; protect perennials; maintain residual heights (per table)       |
| November  | Nurse crops established                                      | Light rotational grazing on nurse crops; monitor perennials for 3–5" residual; allow taller tannin forage 6–8" |
| December–February | Dormant growth                                       | Minimal grazing; hay supplement; monitor any tall tannin forages for selective browsing            |
| March     | Perennials resume growth                                     | Begin light rotational grazing; residual: orchardgrass 3–4", chicory/trefoil 4–5"                  |
| April     | Active growth                                                | Moderate rotation; avoid overgrazing crowns; allow tall tannin forages to reach 6–8"               |
| May       | Well-rooted perennials                                       | Full rotational grazing; occasional trefoil seed-set; maintain tall forage for parasite control    |
| June–August | Summer growth                                              | Maintain rotation, monitor residual and max heights; adjust paddocks to keep high-quality forage    |

## Stocking & Rotation Plan

- **Paddocks:** 8 (~0.875 acres each)  
- **Rotation:** 1 paddock per week  
- **DM Demand:** 25 goats × 150 lbs × 4% BW/day → 1,050 lbs DM/week  
- **Available DM per paddock:** ~2,188 lbs → ~50% utilization → light grazing  

**Tips:**
- Monitor paddocks for bare spots, pulled tillers, or low crowns.  
- Adjust rotation frequency or reduce herd density if seedlings stressed.  
- Use tall tannin forages strategically for parasite control.

## Success Notes / Research-Backed Tips

- Sericea lespedeza and birdsfoot trefoil provide tannins that help reduce parasite burdens.  
- Tall perennials and height diversity improve selective grazing and reduce worm intake.  
- Nurse crops protect seedlings, provide early forage, and thin as perennials mature.  
- Trace mineral supplementation is recommended for goats to maintain optimal health.
