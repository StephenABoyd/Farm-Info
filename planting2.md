# SW Missouri No-Till Perennial + Nurse-Crop Plan for Goats (Revised with Calendar)

---

## Seed Mix (per acre, fall drill)

| Species | Rate (lb/acre) | Lifecycle | Benefit | Notes / Caveats |
|---------|----------------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Orchardgrass | 10 | Perennial | Persistent base, high fiber, palatable | Drill ¼–½"; avoid grazing first year |
| Chicory | 4 | Perennial | Deep taproot, mineral-dense, digestible | Residual 4–5"; sensitive to overgrazing |
| Birdsfoot trefoil | 3 | Perennial | Tannins reduce bloat, parasite control, moderate protein | Slow to establish; allow occasional seed-set |
| Red clover | 4 | Perennial (short-lived) | High protein, fills gaps | Overseed as needed |
| White clover | 2 | Perennial | Nitrogen fixer, fills low spots | Keep moderate grazing height |
| Sericea lespedeza (AU Grazer) | 2 | Perennial | Tannins for parasite suppression, drought-tolerant | Manage seed set to prevent spread |
| Oats | 10 | Annual | Fast fall forage, protects seedlings | Grazable in fall; dies over winter |
| Cereal rye | 10 | Annual | Winter-hardy, tall biomass, erosion control | Grazable lightly; thins by spring |
| Triticale | 8 | Annual | Rapid establishment, weed suppression | Dies or thins by late spring |
| Annual ryegrass | 3 | Annual / Winter hardy | Early spring grazing, fast regrowth | Plant late fall; adds winter forage |

**Notes:**

- Nurse crops protect seedlings and provide early forage.  
- Reduced nurse crops slightly to favor perennials establishing faster.  
- Added small amount of annual ryegrass for early spring cover.

## Month-by-Month Establishment & Grazing

| Month | Activities | Grazing Guidance |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| **September** | Soil test, lime/fertilizer, firm seedbed, drill seed mix | Keep animals off for 2–3 weeks until emergence |
| **October** | Check seedlings; first leaves visible | Light grazing on nurse crops only if pressure low; protect perennials |
| **November** | Nurse crops established | Light rotational grazing on nurse crops; residual perennials 4–5" |
| **December** | Dormant growth | Minimal grazing; provide hay supplement; trace mineral block available |
| **January** | Dormant growth | Minimal grazing; hay supplement; monitor paddocks for bare spots |
| **February** | Dormant growth | Continue supplemental hay; maintain trace mineral availability |
| **March** | Perennials resume growth | Begin light rotational grazing; residual orchardgrass 3–4", chicory/trefoil 4–5" |
| **April** | Active growth | Moderate rotation; monitor regrowth; avoid overgrazing crowns |
| **May** | Well-rooted perennials | Full rotational grazing; allow occasional trefoil seed-set for stand maintenance |
| **June** | Summer growth | Maintain rotation, residuals, monitor tannin forage access for parasite control |
| **July** | Summer growth | Maintain rotation; check for bare spots and overgrazed areas |
| **August** | Summer growth | Continue rotation; prepare for fall forage establishment and reseeding as needed |

## Stocking & Rotation Plan

- **Paddocks:** 8 (~0.875 acres each)  
- **Rotation:** 1 paddock per week  
- **DM Demand:** 25 goats × 150 lbs × 4% BW/day → 1,050 lbs DM/week  
- **Available DM per paddock:** ~2,188 lbs → ~50% utilization → light grazing  

**Residual height targets:**

- Orchardgrass/fescue: ≥3–4"  
- Chicory/trefoil: ≥4–5"  
- Clovers: ≥3–4"  

**Supplement:** 1 square bale/week during establishment; trace mineral block year-round  

**Tips:**

- Monitor paddocks for bare spots, pulled tillers, or low crowns.  
- Adjust rotation or herd density if seedlings stressed.  
- Use nurse crops as forage buffer; minimal fencing required.

## Success Notes / Research-Backed Tips

- **Sericea lespedeza (AU Grazer):** Reduces fecal egg counts; manage seed set.  
- **Chicory:** Mineral-dense, digestible forage; helps early-season nutrition.  
- **Birdsfoot trefoil:** Bloat-safe, tannin-rich protein.  
- **Winter/early spring coverage:** Annual ryegrass adds green forage during perennials’ slow growth.  
- **Micronutrient support:** Trace minerals (Cu, Se, Co, Zn) recommended for optimal goat health.

### Key Improvements:

1. Slightly reduced nurse crops to favor long-term perennial establishment.  
2. Added small amount of winter-hardy annual ryegrass for early spring grazing.  
3. Emphasized mineral supplementation for goats.  
4. Full monthly calendar restored with grazing guidance for each period.
