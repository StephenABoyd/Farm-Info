# SW Missouri No-Till Perennial + Nurse-Crop Plan for Goats (Revised)

---

## Seed Mix (per acre, fall drill)

| Species | Rate (lb/acre) | Lifecycle | Benefit | Notes / Caveats |
|---------|----------------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Orchardgrass | 10 | Perennial | Persistent base, high fiber, palatable | Drill ¼–½"; avoid grazing first year |
| Chicory | 4 | Perennial | Deep taproot, mineral-dense, digestible | Residual 4–5"; sensitive to overgrazing |
| Birdsfoot trefoil | 3 | Perennial | Tannins reduce bloat, parasite control, moderate protein | Slow to establish; allow occasional seed-set |
| Red clover | 4 | Perennial (short-lived) | High protein, fills gaps | Overseed as needed |
| White clover | 2 | Perennial | Nitrogen fixer, fills low spots | Keep moderate grazing height |
| Sericea lespedeza (AU Grazer) | 2 | Perennial | Tannins for parasite suppression, drought-tolerant | Manage seed set to prevent spread |
| Oats | 10 | Annual | Fast fall forage, protects seedlings | Grazable in fall; dies over winter |
| Cereal rye | 10 | Annual | Winter-hardy, tall biomass, erosion control | Grazable lightly; thins by spring |
| Triticale | 8 | Annual | Rapid establishment, weed suppression | Dies or thins by late spring |
| Annual ryegrass (small % cover) | 3 | Annual / Winter hardy | Early spring grazing, fast regrowth | Plant late fall; adds winter forage |

**Notes:**

- Reduced oats, rye, and triticale slightly to allow perennials to dominate faster.  
- Added a small amount of **annual ryegrass** for early spring cover.  
- Nurse crops still protect seedlings and provide early forage.

## Month-by-Month Establishment & Grazing

| Month | Activities | Grazing Guidance |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| September | Soil test, lime/fertilizer, firm seedbed, drill seed mix | Keep animals off for 2–3 weeks until emergence |
| October | Check seedlings; first leaves visible | Light grazing on nurse crops if pressure low; protect perennials |
| November | Nurse crops established | Light rotational grazing on nurse crops; residual perennials 4–5" |
| December–February | Dormant growth | Minimal grazing; provide supplemental hay; consider trace mineral block for goats |
| March | Perennials resume growth | Light rotational grazing; residual orchardgrass 3–4", chicory/trefoil 4–5" |
| April | Active growth | Moderate rotation; monitor regrowth; avoid overgrazing crowns |
| May | Well-rooted perennials | Full rotational grazing; occasional trefoil seed-set for stand maintenance |
| June–August | Summer growth | Maintain rotation, residuals, monitor tannin forage access for parasite control |

## Stocking & Rotation Plan

- **Paddocks:** 8 (~0.875 acres each)  
- **Rotation:** 1 paddock per week  
- **DM Demand:** 25 goats × 150 lbs × 4% BW/day → 1,050 lbs DM/week  
- **Available DM per paddock:** ~2,188 lbs → ~50% utilization → light grazing  

**Residual height targets:**

- Orchardgrass/fescue: ≥3–4"  
- Chicory/trefoil: ≥4–5"  
- Clovers: ≥3–4"  

**Supplement:** 1 square bale/week during establishment; trace mineral block year-round  

**Tips:**

- Monitor paddocks for bare spots, pulled tillers, or low crowns.  
- Adjust rotation or herd density if seedlings stressed.  
- Use nurse crops as forage buffer; minimal fencing required.

## Success Notes / Research-Backed Tips

- **Sericea lespedeza (AU Grazer):** Reduces fecal egg counts; manage seed set.  
- **Chicory:** Adds mineral-dense, digestible forage.  
- **Birdsfoot trefoil:** Bloat-safe, tannin-rich protein.  
- **Winter/early spring coverage:** Annual ryegrass adds green forage during perennials’ slow growth.  
- **Micronutrient support:** Trace minerals (Cu, Se, Co, Zn) recommended for optimal goat health.

### Key Improvements:

1. Slightly reduced nurse crops to favor long-term perennial establishment.  
2. Added small amount of winter-hardy annual ryegrass for early spring grazing.  
3. Emphasized mineral supplementation for goats.  
4. Maintained rotational grazing and residual targets to protect seedlings.
