## 🗓 Month-by-Month Plan

### **January – February**
**Key Tasks**

- Ensure coop is dry, draft-free, and well-ventilated.

**Goal / Notes**
> Keep hens in good body condition for spring fertility.  
> Cold weather sharply reduces hatch success.

### **March**
**Key Tasks**
- Crack test eggs mid-month to check for fertility (look for a bullseye).  
- Begin saving hatching eggs late March if fertile.  
- Prepare incubator or broody hens by month’s end.

**Goal / Notes**
> Fertility begins improving as daylight increases.

### **April**
**Key Tasks**
